# Almonds Product Image Prompt

## Description
Create a premium product image showcasing Moroccan almonds in their most appealing form. The image should feature both whole almonds with shells and shelled almonds to display the product range. Arrange the almonds artistically on a small traditional Moroccan wooden plate or ceramic dish with subtle decorative patterns. The composition should highlight the texture, color variation, and quality of the almonds while maintaining a clean, professional product photography style with a touch of Moroccan aesthetic.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 600 600"
- Square format for consistent display in product grid
- Design should work effectively at thumbnail sizes (200x200) as well

## Color Palette
- Natural almond colors:
  - Light beige shell (#E8DCCA)
  - Medium brown shell accents (#C8B39C)
  - Cream almond flesh (#F9F1E6)
- Supporting elements:
  - Rich wooden brown for plate/surface (#8B5A2B)
  - Subtle turquoise/teal accents (#1D7874) for any decorative elements
  - Warm cream background (#FAF3E3) with very subtle texture

## Style Guidance
- Clean, product-focused composition with minimal styling
- Photorealistic vector rendering with attention to natural texture details
- Soft directional lighting from upper left to create gentle shadows
- Arrange almonds to show variety in shapes and subtle color variations
- Include both in-shell and shelled almonds to demonstrate product variety
- Background should be clean and minimal, with subtle texture only
- Add a hint of traditional Moroccan design in any dishware or surface elements

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Optimize for web use with appropriate detail level
- Use consistent lighting and shadow style across all product images
- Implement proper layering for easier manipulation
- Ensure the product remains clear and identifiable at smaller sizes

## Additional Notes
- This image will be part of a product catalog, so maintain consistency with other nut products
- Focus should be on product quality and natural appearance
- The almonds should look fresh, premium, and appetizing
- Include enough negative space to accommodate potential text overlay
- Image should convey artisanal quality and natural origin
