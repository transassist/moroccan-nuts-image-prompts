# Walnuts Product Image Prompt

## Description
Create a premium product image showcasing Moroccan walnuts. The composition should feature both whole walnuts in their shells and cracked walnuts showing the brain-like interior. Arrange the walnuts artistically on a small ornate Moroccan metal plate with intricate engravings. The image should highlight the texture, ridges, and natural variations of the walnuts while maintaining a clean, professional product photography style with authentic Moroccan aesthetic touches.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 600 600"
- Square format for consistent display in product grid
- Design should work effectively at thumbnail sizes (200x200) as well

## Color Palette
- Natural walnut colors:
  - Medium to dark brown shell (#5D4037, #3E2723)
  - Light golden-brown walnut meat (#D7CCC8, #BCAAA4)
  - Shell texture variations with lighter highlights (#8D6E63)
- Supporting elements:
  - Polished brass/copper for plate (#CD7F32 with metallic highlights)
  - Subtle teal accents (#1D7874) in any decorative elements
  - Warm cream background (#FAF3E3) with very subtle texture

## Style Guidance
- Clean, product-focused composition with minimal styling
- Photorealistic vector rendering with detailed textures on walnut shells
- Soft directional lighting to emphasize the natural grooves and ridges of the walnuts
- Include both whole and halved/quartered walnuts to show interior
- The Moroccan plate should have authentic engraved patterns typical of traditional metalwork
- Place a few walnut pieces outside the plate for compositional interest
- Background should be clean with very subtle texture

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Pay special attention to the intricate texture of walnut shells and meat
- Optimize for web use with appropriate detail level
- Use consistent lighting and shadow style across all product images
- Implement proper layering for easier manipulation
- Ensure the product remains clear and identifiable at smaller sizes

## Additional Notes
- This image will be part of a product catalog, so maintain consistency with other nut products
- Focus should be on product quality and natural appearance
- The walnuts should look fresh, premium, and appetizing
- Include enough negative space to accommodate potential text overlay
- The metallic plate should add a touch of Moroccan craftsmanship without overwhelming the nuts
- Create visual interest through varied walnut positions (stacked, grouped, individual)
