# Argan Product Image Prompt

## Description
Create a premium product image showcasing Moroccan argan nuts and argan oil. The composition should feature both the natural argan nuts (still in their distinctive hard shells) and a small decorative glass bottle of golden argan oil. Arrange these on a traditional Moroccan surface with subtle design elements. The image should highlight the unique appearance of argan nuts and the rich golden color of the oil, emphasizing the product's premium quality and Moroccan origin.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 600 600"
- Square format for consistent display in product grid
- Design should work effectively at thumbnail sizes (200x200) as well

## Color Palette
- Natural argan colors:
  - Light brown argan nut shells (#BEA78A)
  - Golden argan oil (#D4AF37 with transparency)
- Supporting elements:
  - Clear/light blue glass for oil bottle (#E1EBEE with transparency)
  - Rich wooden brown for surface (#8B5A2B)
  - Subtle burgundy/deep red (#8B0000) for any textile elements
  - Warm cream background (#FAF3E3) with very subtle texture

## Style Guidance
- Clean, product-focused composition with minimal styling
- Photorealistic vector rendering with attention to natural texture details
- Soft directional lighting to highlight the oil's translucency and golden color
- Arrange argan nuts to show their distinctive round, bumpy exterior
- The oil bottle should be traditional Moroccan style with decorative elements
- Include a small pour of oil near the nuts to show texture and color
- Background should be clean with subtle Moroccan-inspired pattern elements

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Special attention to glass and liquid rendering techniques
- Optimize for web use with appropriate detail level
- Use consistent lighting and shadow style across all product images
- Implement proper layering for easier manipulation
- Ensure the product remains clear and identifiable at smaller sizes

## Additional Notes
- This image will be part of a product catalog, so maintain consistency with other nut products
- Argan products are considered premium in Moroccan culture, so emphasize luxury
- The image should communicate both beauty and utility of the product
- Argan is unique to Morocco, so subtle geographic/cultural references are appropriate
- Include enough negative space to accommodate potential text overlay
- The combination of nuts and oil should tell the story of the product's processing
