# Navigation Icons Set Prompt

## Description
Create a cohesive set of navigation icons for the website that blend modern UI functionality with subtle Moroccan design influences. The set should include icons for: Home, Products, About Us, Contact, Search, Cart, User Account, and Language Toggle (Arabic/English). Each icon should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes while maintaining a consistent style that complements the Moroccan aesthetic of the website.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 24 24" for each icon
- All icons should maintain consistent visual weight and proportions
- Each icon should have proper padding within its viewBox

## Color Palette
- Primary icon colors:
  - Dark brown (#4A3636) for main states
  - Terracotta/amber (#C77B43) for hover/active states
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) for selected states
- Transparent backgrounds for flexibility

## Style Guidance
- Clean, minimalist base designs with subtle Moroccan flourishes
- Use slightly rounded corners or terminals instead of sharp angles
- Incorporate very subtle geometric patterns into some negative spaces
- Maintain strong silhouettes that are recognizable at small sizes
- Line weight should be consistent across all icons (approximately 1.5-2px)
- Create a balanced set where no single icon feels heavier or more detailed than others
- Add small Moroccan-inspired decorative elements where appropriate

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute for each icon
- Create each icon with states (normal, hover, active, selected)
- Design each icon for both light and dark mode compatibility
- Optimize SVG code for web performance
- Use simple paths with minimal points
- Ensure proper alignment to pixel grid for crisp rendering
- Include appropriate ARIA labels in the SVG code

## Additional Notes
- Icons will be used in both desktop and mobile navigation
- Each icon needs to work well in both LTR and RTL layouts
- The language toggle icon should clearly indicate Arabic/English switching
- The Product icon could incorporate a subtle nut shape
- The Home icon could have a slight Moroccan doorway influence
- Icons should function well at sizes from 16x16px to 48x48px
- Consider creating a sprite sheet version for optimal loading
