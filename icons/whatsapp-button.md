# WhatsApp Button Icon Prompt

## Description
Create a visually appealing WhatsApp contact button that blends the standard WhatsApp logo with Moroccan design elements. The button should be instantly recognizable as a WhatsApp contact option while incorporating subtle Moroccan design touches. It should stand out on the page without clashing with the overall aesthetic of the website. The design should work well for both English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL) layouts.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 240 80"
- Button should have proper padding and touch target size
- Design should scale appropriately for mobile devices

## Color Palette
- Primary WhatsApp green (#25D366)
- WhatsApp white (#FFFFFF) for the phone icon
- Complementary Moroccan colors:
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) for border or accents
  - Terracotta/amber (#C77B43) for subtle decorative elements
  - Dark brown (#4A3636) for text if needed

## Style Guidance
- Maintain the recognizable WhatsApp logo (speech bubble with phone) at the left side
- Add subtle Moroccan geometric border patterns or corner elements
- Include localized text "Contact via WhatsApp" (in English and/or Arabic as needed)
- Use rounded corners consistent with Moroccan arched design
- Create a hover/active state with slightly different appearance
- The button should have a clean, professional appearance while maintaining brand identity

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Create as a responsive component that maintains proportions
- Design the button with states (normal, hover, active) using different layers
- Optimize for web use with minimal file size
- Ensure the button can adapt to different width constraints
- Text should be converted to paths for consistent display

## Additional Notes
- This button will be prominently featured throughout the site
- The design should clearly communicate the WhatsApp contact functionality
- Include appropriate spacing for RTL text variations
- Button should look appealing against both light and dark backgrounds
- Consider accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- The button should be eye-catching without being overly flashy
