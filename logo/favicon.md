# Favicon Prompt

## Description
Create a simplified version of the main Moroccan Nuts logo optimized for use as a favicon. This should be a compact, recognizable icon that works well at very small sizes. Focus on the most distinctive element from the main logo (likely the stylized nut or geometric pattern), ensuring it remains clear even at 16x16 pixels. The icon should maintain the brand's Moroccan aesthetic while being instantly recognizable.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 32 32"
- Must be clearly visible at 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels
- Design should be simple enough to work as a browser tab icon

## Color Palette
- Use the same core colors as the main logo:
  - Rich terracotta/amber (#C77B43) as primary color
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) as secondary color
  - Warm cream (#F4EAD5) for contrast elements
  - Dark brown (#4A3636) for outline or details

## Style Guidance
- Extreme simplification of the main logo concept
- Focus on a single distinctive element (e.g., a stylized almond or argan nut)
- Use solid shapes with minimal detail
- Maintain brand recognition despite the simplified form
- Ensure the design is balanced and visually centered

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Must be legible at 16x16 pixels when rendered
- Use solid color fills only (no gradients)
- Optimize paths for smallest possible file size
- Ensure the design works against both light and dark browser themes

## Additional Notes
- The favicon should immediately connect to the main logo in the user's mind
- Consider how it will appear in browser tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens
- Should be distinct enough to stand out among other favicons
- Test rendering at 16x16 pixels to ensure clarity
