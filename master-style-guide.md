# Master Style Guide for Moroccan Nuts Website Images

This document provides comprehensive style guidance for all images created for the Moroccan Nuts e-commerce website. These guidelines ensure visual consistency across all website elements while maintaining the authentic Moroccan aesthetic that defines the brand.

## Core Visual Identity

### Brand Essence
- **Premium Quality**: All images should convey high-end, artisanal quality
- **Authentic Moroccan**: Visual elements should authentically reflect Moroccan cultural heritage without resorting to stereotypes
- **Natural & Organic**: Imagery should emphasize the natural, organic nature of the products
- **Traditional Craftsmanship**: Subtle references to traditional methods and attention to detail
- **Modern Presentation**: While inspired by tradition, the overall aesthetic should feel contemporary and refined

### Master Color Palette
All images should adhere to this cohesive color palette:

- **Primary Colors**
  - Rich terracotta/amber (#C77B43) - representing roasted nuts
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) - representing Moroccan tiles
  - Warm cream (#F4EAD5) - representing nut flesh
  - Dark brown (#4A3636) - representing deep roasted nuts

- **Secondary/Accent Colors**
  - Olive green (#7D8C38) - for natural/organic elements
  - Saffron yellow (#F4C430) - for accent details only
  - Burgundy/deep red (#8B0000) - for textile patterns
  - Gold (#D4AF37) - used sparingly for premium accents

### Typography Guidance (for any text in images)
- Primary font: A clean sans-serif for modern elements
- Secondary font: A subtle Arabic-inspired font for decorative elements
- Text should be minimal in images and always created as paths in SVG
- Allow adequate space for both LTR and RTL text implementations

## Design Elements

### Moroccan Pattern Motifs
- **Geometric Patterns**: Based on traditional zellige tilework with 8-fold or 16-fold symmetry
- **Arabesques**: Flowing, interconnected curved patterns inspired by Islamic art
- **Star Patterns**: Multi-pointed stars common in Moroccan design
- **Arches**: Characteristic horseshoe or keyhole arch shapes

### Texture Treatments
- Subtle paper or fabric textures may be used at very low opacity (5-10%)
- Wood grain textures for certain elements, particularly in product photography
- Textural elements should enhance rather than dominate the design

### Image Style & Technique
- **Vector Format**: All images must be delivered as optimized SVGs
- **Line Weight**: Consistent line weights within each image category
- **Detail Level**: Appropriate detail for intended display size
- **Opacity Variation**: Use varied opacity to create depth and focus
- **Lighting**: Consistent light source (preferably upper left) across all images

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technical Specifications
- All images must be in SVG format with proper viewBox attributes
- File size optimization is critical for web performance
- All SVGs should be responsive and scale appropriately
- Images should render consistently across modern browsers
- Use appropriate grouping and structure in SVG code

### Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain adequate contrast for text elements
- Include appropriate ARIA labels and descriptions
- Consider how images will be interpreted by screen readers
- Test all images against both light and dark backgrounds

### Multilingual Support
- All asymmetrical designs must have both LTR and RTL versions
- Allow appropriate space for text expansion in translated content
- Text elements should be isolated for easy translation
