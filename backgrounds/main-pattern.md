# Main Background Pattern Prompt

## Description
Create a subtle, elegant Moroccan-inspired geometric pattern to serve as the website's main background texture. The pattern should incorporate traditional Moroccan zellige tile design elements but in a simplified, modern interpretation that won't compete with foreground content. The pattern should be tileable/repeatable and create a continuous background when implemented. The design should provide visual interest without being distracting and should complement the warm, natural aesthetic of a premium nut products website.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 200 200"
- Designed to be seamlessly tileable when repeated
- Pattern elements should be small and subtle

## Color Palette
- Primary background color: Warm cream (#FAF3E3)
- Pattern colors:
  - Very light terracotta (#EACBB4) - barely visible
  - Subtle teal (#D5E5E4)
  - Light amber (#F0E0C6)
  - All colors should be used at low opacity (10-20%)

## Style Guidance
- Geometric Moroccan-inspired design with 8-fold or 16-fold symmetry
- Extremely subtle - the pattern should be barely noticeable at first glance
- Clean, thin lines (0.5px or less) for the geometric elements
- Incorporate classic Moroccan star patterns and interlocking shapes
- The pattern should feel airy and light, not dense or busy
- Design should work well with both LTR and RTL layouts
- Create a sense of texture rather than prominent pattern

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Optimize for seamless tiling with no visible seams
- Use minimal points and path data for optimal performance
- Test pattern tiling to ensure no unintended visual artifacts when repeated
- Keep file size extremely small for background use (under 5KB if possible)
- Structure paths efficiently for rendering performance
- Pattern should display consistently across browsers

## Additional Notes
- This pattern will serve as the site's base texture throughout all pages
- The subtlety is critical - it should enhance without distracting
- Pattern should work well under both text content and images
- Should print well even when background printing is enabled
- Consider how the pattern will appear on both small mobile screens and large desktop displays
- The pattern should evoke Moroccan craftsmanship without being overtly ethnic or themed
- Test the pattern at different zoom levels to ensure it remains visually pleasing
