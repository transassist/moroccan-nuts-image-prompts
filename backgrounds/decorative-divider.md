# Decorative Section Divider Prompt

## Description
Create an elegant, horizontal decorative divider inspired by Moroccan design elements to be used as a section separator throughout the website. The divider should incorporate subtle nut motifs (almonds, argan, walnuts) integrated with traditional Moroccan geometric patterns. The design should be ornamental yet refined, creating visual interest between content sections without overwhelming the page. It should be versatile enough to work against different background colors and complement the overall Moroccan aesthetic of the site.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 800 60"
- Designed to span full width of content areas
- Height should be modest to serve as a divider rather than major visual element

## Color Palette
- Primary colors:
  - Rich terracotta/amber (#C77B43)
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874)
  - Warm cream (#F4EAD5)
  - Dark brown (#4A3636)
- All colors should be used with gradient opacity to create subtle fade-in/fade-out effect at edges

## Style Guidance
- Central geometric pattern with symmetrical design
- Incorporate subtle stylized nut shapes as decorative elements
- Include classic Moroccan motifs like arches, stars, or interlocking geometric shapes
- Design should fade gracefully at both ends for fluid integration with content
- Style should be delicate and refined rather than heavy or chunky
- Balance positive and negative space for an airy, elegant appearance
- Should work equally well in both LTR and RTL layouts

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Create variants with different widths (800px, 600px, 400px) for responsive layouts
- Optimize paths for rendering performance and file size
- Use gradients sparingly and efficiently
- Design should scale gracefully to different widths
- Include transparent areas appropriately to allow background to show through
- Structure SVG for possible CSS animation (separating elements that might animate)

## Additional Notes
- This divider will be used throughout the site between major content sections
- Should feel cohesive with the main background pattern but more prominent
- Must look elegant in both color and monochrome/print versions
- Consider how the divider might be adapted for vertical use in some contexts
- Design horizontal variants with different levels of decorative complexity for different contexts
- The divider should enhance the premium feel of the brand
- Test against both light and dark backgrounds to ensure versatility
