# Company Values Icons Set Prompt

## Description
Create a set of five cohesive icons representing the core values of the Moroccan Nuts company: Quality, Tradition, Sustainability, Community, and Innovation. Each icon should blend modern icon design with subtle Moroccan aesthetic elements and relate thematically to nut production or Moroccan culture. The icons should work together as a visual system while clearly communicating their individual values. The style should be clean and professional with decorative Moroccan touches that elevate them beyond standard corporate icons.
