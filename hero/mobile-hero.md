# Mobile Hero Image Prompt

## Description
Create a vertically-oriented version of the main hero image optimized for mobile devices. This image should feature the same premium Moroccan nuts arrangement but with a vertical composition that allows for text overlay at the top or bottom. The focus should be tighter, highlighting fewer elements but with greater detail. The image should maintain the authentic Moroccan aesthetic while being optimized for smaller screens and vertical scrolling.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 600 900"
- Designed specifically for mobile device viewing
- Should scale appropriately for various phone screen sizes

## Color Palette
- Same rich earth tones as the main hero:
  - Warm browns (#8B4513, #A0522D) for wooden elements and roasted nuts
  - Terracotta/amber (#C77B43) for pottery and design elements
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) for decorative accents
  - Warm cream (#F4EAD5) for backgrounds and lighter elements
  - Hints of saffron yellow (#F4C430) and deep red (#8B0000) for fabric patterns

## Style Guidance
- Maintain the same photorealistic vector style as the main hero image
- Use a more focused composition with fewer elements but greater detail
- Create a more dramatic lighting effect to enhance visual impact on smaller screens
- Include the same Moroccan design elements but simplified for mobile viewing
- Leave clear space at the top third for potential text overlay

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Optimize carefully for mobile performance (smaller file size)
- Use simplified elements where appropriate to reduce rendering complexity
- Ensure the image maintains impact when viewed on small screens
- Test rendering on various mobile device sizes

## Additional Notes
- This mobile-optimized hero should feel like a natural extension of the desktop version
- Focus on 2-3 premium nut varieties rather than showing the full range
- Consider how users will interact with the image on touch devices
- Ensure that any text overlay areas have appropriate contrast for readability
- The vertical composition should naturally lead the eye down to encourage scrolling
