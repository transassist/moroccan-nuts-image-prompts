# Contact Form Decoration Prompt

## Description
Create a decorative SVG element to enhance the contact form section of the website. The decoration should frame the form with subtle Moroccan-inspired design elements while maintaining a clean, professional appearance. The design should incorporate nut motifs and traditional geometric patterns in a way that adds visual interest without overwhelming the functional form elements. The decoration should be asymmetrical, with heavier design elements in the corners and edges, leaving the center area clear for form fields.

## Dimensions
- SVG format with viewBox="0 0 600 800"
- Portrait orientation to frame a vertical contact form
- Design elements should be concentrated at edges/corners

## Color Palette
- Primary decoration colors:
  - Deep teal/turquoise (#1D7874) at 20-40% opacity for geometric patterns
  - Rich terracotta/amber (#C77B43) at 30-50% opacity for nut elements
  - Warm cream (#F4EAD5) for background or lighter elements
  - Dark brown (#4A3636) at 10-30% opacity for subtle accent lines
- All colors should be used with restraint to maintain form usability

## Style Guidance
- Subtle geometric patterns inspired by Moroccan zellige tilework in corners
- Very light, almost watermark-style nut motifs (almond, argan, walnut) integrated into the pattern
- Delicate line work with varying opacity to create depth
- Left and right sides of the decoration may feature vertical pattern elements
- Top and bottom may include more horizontal decorative elements
- Design should fade toward the center where form fields will be placed
- Balance negative and positive space generously favoring negative space
- Style should be elegant and understated, appropriate for a premium brand

## Technical Requirements
- SVG format with proper viewBox attribute
- Optimize for web performance with minimal complexity
- Structure should support responsive scaling without distortion
- Design should complement rather than compete with form elements
- Use opacity and subtle gradients strategically for depth
- Create versions optimized for mobile and desktop views
- Include both LTR and RTL versions if the design isn't symmetrical
- Test rendering against both light and dark backgrounds

## Additional Notes
- This decoration will frame the contact form on the contact page
- The design should enhance rather than distract from form usability
- Consider how the decoration will interact with input fields and buttons
- The decoration should not reduce form readability or accessibility
- Different sections of the decoration may be implemented separately for responsive layouts
- Consider subtle animation possibilities for specific elements
- The decoration should convey a sense of warmth and welcome
- Include subtle variations that could be used on other forms throughout the site
